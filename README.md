### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ this is Thomas

Iâ€™m a software engineer that comes from a physics engineer background. Having developed an interest in technology, I made my career-switching decision in 2019, got a second degree in Computer Science, and have never looked back since then. Following that moment, I have been consistently working on both my technical and soft skills, all while also doing my best to maintain a work-life balance.
